Payment Methods are used as funding sources and disbursement for payments in Mercoa. Some payment methods can only be used as a funding source, others can only be used as a disbursement, and many can be used for both. 

The following table shows the available payment methods and their capabilities.

|--------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- | --------- |

## Bank Account

Bank Accounts can be considered the default payment method in Mercoa. They can be used as a funding source and disbursement method.

### Create a Bank Account

To create a bank account, you need to provide the following information:

- Bank Name
- Account Number
- Routing Number
- Account Type (Checking or Savings)

You can use the [bank lookup endpoint](/api-reference/bank-lookup/find) to get the bank name from the routing number.

### Using a Bank Account as a Funding Source

To use a bank account as a funding source, you need to prove ownership of the account. This is done by depositing a small amount of money into the account and verifying that the amount matches the amount deposited. 
This is done by calling the [Initiate Micro Deposit](/api-reference/payment-method/bank-account/initiate-micro-deposit) endpoint and then the [Verify Micro Deposit](/api-reference/payment-method/bank-account/verify-micro-deposit) endpoint with the appropriate amounts.

### Using a Bank Account as a Disbursement Method

Bank accounts do not need to be verified to be used as a disbursement method.

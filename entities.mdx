## Know Your Customer
Banking regulations require that financial institutions perform a “Know Your Customer” (KYC) process to verify an individual or business identity before enabling certain capabilities. 
All Mercoa accounts are also checked against OFAC and sanctions lists to ensure they are not forbidden from conducting business in the United States.

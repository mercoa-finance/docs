## What is Mercoa

Mercoa is an embedded Accounts Payable platform designed to drop into your product. 
Mercoa provides frontend components that can be whitelabled, and a backend API.

## Getting your API Keys

You can find your API key and Organization ID in the [Mercoa Dashboard](https://mercoa.com/dashboard/developers).

<b>Do NOT expose this key on the frontend</b>, it is for backend use only.

## Create an Entity

Entities are individuals or businesses (your users) that will use the Mercoa platform. Before they can use Mercoa, they will need to be onboarded and go through KYC/KYB checks.

You can use the [API](/api-reference/entity/create), the [Admin UI](https://mercoa.com/dashboard/entities), or contact us to do a bulk upload.

## Add Representatives

If an Entity is a business, they will need to add representatives. A business representative is someone with financial ownership or significant control over a business entity. You can learn more about representatives [here](/business-representatives).

You can add representatives using the [API](/api-reference/representative/create) or the Admin UI.

## Verify Entity

Once all representatives have been added, you can verify the entity. This will trigger KYC/KYB checks and will usually be instant, but might take a few days if manual review is needed.

Use the [API](/api-reference/entity/update) or the Admin UI to verify the entity. When using the API, set the `ownersProvided` field to `true`.

## Create a Bank Account

<Note> Instant Account Verification via Plaid is coming soon. If you already use Plaid to verify bank accounts, the existing Plaid token can be used. Please contact us for more information.</Note>

Once the entity is verified, you can add a bank account.

Use the [API](/api-reference/payment-method/create) or the Admin UI to add a bank account. When using the API, set the `type` field to `bankAccount`, and provide a `bankAccount` object.

If you do not know the `bankName`, you can use the [Bank Lookup API](/api-reference/bank-lookup/find) to find it using the routing number.

## Verify Bank Account

Once the bank account is added, it must be verified before funds can be pulled to pay an invoice. This will trigger a micro-deposit to the bank account, and you or your user will need to verify the amounts.

Use the [API](/api-reference/payment-method/bank-account/initiate-micro-deposit) or the Admin UI to initiate the micro-deposits.

Once the micro-deposits are posted into the account, you can use the [API](/api-reference/payment-method/bank-account/verify-micro-deposit) or the Admin UI to verify the amounts. This can take 2-3 business days.

## Accept the Terms of Service

Before invoices can be created for an entity, the entity must accept the Terms of Service. You **must** show a link to the [Mercoa Terms of Service](https://mercoa.com/legal/platform-agreement) to your users.

Once the user has accepted the Terms of Service, you can use the [API](/api-reference/entity/accept-tos) or the Admin UI to update the entity.

## Create an Invoice

Once the entity has accepted the Terms of Service, you can create an invoice for them. You can use the [API](/api-reference/invoice/create) or the Admin UI to create an invoice.

<Note>
  An invoice needs a payer entity and a vendor entity. Your customer is the payer, and payers need to be verified and have a verified bank account.
  The vendor entity needs to be created, but only needs basic information like the legal name, email, and type of business. Vendor entities also do not need verified bank accounts.


  An invoice can also be created without a `paymentDestinationId`, but we reccomend that you provide one. This will allow the invoice to be paid even if the vendor does not enter their information in the vendor portal.
</Note>

If you have an PDF or image of the invoice, you can upload it using the `uploadedImage` field as a base64 encoded string. You can also extract information from the image or PDF using the [OCR endpoint](/api-reference/ocr).

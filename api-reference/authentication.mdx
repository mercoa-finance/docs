There are two ways to authenticate with the API: **API Keys** and **JWT tokens**.

## API Keys

You can find your API key in the [developers](https://mercoa.com/dashboard/developers) section of your account. This API key can be used to control any entity or invoice created in your organization. 

<Warning>This key should only be used on the server side, do not use this key in the browser.</Warning>

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <api_key>'
```

## JWT Tokens

You can generate a JWT token for any entity in your organization, and use this JWT directly in the browser to preform actions as that entity. This means you don't need any server-side code to use Mercoa in your product.

You can generate the JWT using the Mercoa API or directly on your server.

### Using the API

Use this [API endpoint](/api-reference/entity/token) to have Mercoa generate a JWT for the entity you specify.

### Generating a JWT yourself

To generate a JWT yourself, you need to sign a JWT with your Mercoa API key. This can be faster than using the Mercoa API to generate the token as there is one less network call.

You can use any JWT library to do this, but here is an example using [async-jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async-jsonwebtoken)
  
```JavaScript
import * as jwt from 'async-jsonwebtoken'

const key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
const organizationId = 'YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID'

async function generateJWT(entityId){
  const [token] = await jwt.sign({ organizationId, entityId }, key)
  return token
}
```

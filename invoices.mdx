# Lifecycle of an invoice

An invoice represents an obligation owed by a business to pay off a short-term debt to its vendors for products or services that were purchased.

An invoice goes through many steps before it is paid off.

The invoice lifecycle is as follows:

# 1. Draft

If an invoice is created but doesn't have all the required fields set, it will be in the `DRAFT` state. An invoice cannot be sent to the vendor in this state. Invoices created by forwarding an email will be in this state until approved by the user as well.

# 2. New

When an invoice is created and all the required fields are set, it will be in the `NEW` state. 

In this state, the invoice will have the following:

### Payer

The `payer` is the [Entity](/entities) that is paying the invoice.

To fund an invoice, the `paymenMethodSource` needs to be set. This should be a `paymentMethod` owned by the `payer` that is verified. 

### Vendor

The vendor is the [Entity](/entities) that is receiving the payment for the invoice. 

Before a payment can be disbursed to a vendor, the `paymentMethodDestination` needs to be set. 

If the `paymentMethodDestination` is not set, the vendor will need to add their payment details before the invoice can be paid. Mercoa will email the vendor with a link where the vendor can create a `paymentMethodDestination` and accept the payment. 

If the vendor does not add their payment details, a backup `paymentMethodDestination` can be set on the invoice.

### Amount

The `amount` is the total amount of the invoice. This is the amount that will be paid to the vendor.

### Due Date and Deduction Date

The `dueDate` is the date that the invoice is due. The `deductionDate` is the date that the invoice amount will be deducted from the payer's account.

# 3. Pending

On the `deductionDate`, the payment will be triggered and the invoice will be in the `PENDING` state. This means that the invoice amount will be deducted from the payer's account and sent to the vendor.

# 4. Paid

When the invoice amount is received by the vendor, the invoice will be in the `PAID` state.
